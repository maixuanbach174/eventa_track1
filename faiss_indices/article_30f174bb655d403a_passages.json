      "text": "New York (CNN Business)Burger King is trying to suspend its operations in Russia, but that's proving difficult.

The burger chain, owned by Restaurant Brands International (QSR), has a joint venture partnership with businessman Alexander Kolobov in Russia. RBI controls just 15% of its Russian Burger King business, and Kolobov is responsible for the \"day-to-day operations and oversight\" of its locations in the country. That means Burger King can't just snap its fingers and close up shop. \" We started the process to dispose [of] our ownership stake in the business,\" said David Shear, president of RBI's international operations, in an open letter. \""
